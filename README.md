# PyTorch-MLP-for-personalized-dress-matching

# 1 Introduction

We used MLP to train a model, which can recommend clothes for the day based on the weather. Since the labeled data is annotated by one person, you can also get personalized recommendations for wearing styles through our network.

`data.csv` is the raw data, which is crawled from the website: http://www.tianqihoubao.com/lishi/chengdu/month/202001.html (you can replace `202001` with the year and month you want); `data_1.csv` is the labeled data; `parameters_layerx.pkl` is the trained parameters, where 'x' represents how many hidden layers; and other files are intermediate data generated by preprocessing.

# 2 Version
1. OS: Windows;
2. Python: 3.7.11；
3. PyTorch: 1.6.0, cpu

# 3 How to use

`crawler.py` is the crawler; `preprocess.py` is used to preprocess labeled data; and `mlp.py` is the model, which contains the model, the train method, and the evaluate method.

1. If you want to train the model by yourself, just delete or rename the file `parameters_layerx.pkl`;
2. If you want to use our trained parameters, Just enter the following code:

```python
python mlp.py -h
```
where this code shows the help message, and
```python
python mlp.py -s 夏 -hi 34 -l 28 -m 晴 -n 晴
```
where this code can get the output:
```python
今日适合穿: T恤（短） 牛仔裤 帆布鞋 老爹鞋
```
